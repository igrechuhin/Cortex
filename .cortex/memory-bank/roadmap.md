# Roadmap: MCP Memory Bank

**This file records future/upcoming work only.** Completed work is recorded in [activeContext.md](activeContext.md). Do not duplicate entries between the two files.

**Implementation sequence**: The implement command picks the **next** step as the **first PENDING item** when reading the roadmap in this order: (1) Blockers (ASAP Priority), (2) Active Work, (3) Future Enhancements, (4) Implementation queue (Pending plans). Order within each section is top-to-bottom. New plans are added by create-plan in the correct place so this order defines execution.

## Blockers (ASAP Priority)

## Active Work (in progress)

## Future Enhancements

## Pending plans (from .cortex/plans)

- **Synapse Usage Storage with usage_writable and Static Snapshot Mode** - PENDING - Store tool usage in Synapse when usage_writable=true; when false, operate as static snapshot (no stats writes for tools/prompts/resources).

### Investigation Plans (Archive / Reference)
