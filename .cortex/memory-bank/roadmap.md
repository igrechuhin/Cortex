# Roadmap: MCP Memory Bank

## Current Status (2026-01-13)

### Active Work

- None (all active work completed)

### Recent Findings

- ✅ **Phase 14: Centralize Path Resolution** - COMPLETE (2026-01-13) - Replaced 24+ instances of direct path construction with centralized `get_cortex_path()` calls across 7 files - All tests passing, consistent path resolution throughout codebase
- ✅ **Plan Archival**: Archived 110 completed plans to `.cortex/plans/archive/` organized by phase - Improved plan directory organization and compliance with archival requirements (2026-01-13)
- ✅ **Legacy SharedRulesManager Migration**: Completed migration from SharedRulesManager to SynapseManager - All tests migrated, documentation updated, legacy references removed (2026-01-13)
- ✅ **Test Path Resolution Fixed**: Fixed 8 test failures in `test_phase2_linking.py` by using centralized path helpers - All tests now use `.cortex/memory-bank/` consistently (2026-01-13)
- ✅ **Path Helper Utilities Created**: Added `tests/helpers/path_helpers.py` and `src/cortex/core/path_resolver.py` for centralized path resolution (2026-01-13)
- ✅ **Path Resolution Fixed**: MCP tools now correctly use `.cortex/memory-bank/` directory structure - Fixed in `phase2_linking.py` and integration tests (2026-01-13)
- ✅ **Type Safety**: Fixed type errors in `pre_commit_tools.py` by adding `CheckStats` TypedDict (2026-01-13)
- ✅ **Code Quality**: Fixed function length violations in `file_operations.py` by extracting helper function (2026-01-13)
- ✅ **Code Quality**: Fixed function length violations in pre-commit tools and Python adapter (2026-01-13)
- ✅ **Architectural Improvement**: Commit workflow now uses structured MCP tools instead of prompt files - See [Phase 12](../plans/phase-12-commit-workflow-mcp-tools.md) for details
