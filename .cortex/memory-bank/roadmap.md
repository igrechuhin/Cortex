# Roadmap: MCP Memory Bank

## Current Status (2026-01-11)

### Shared Rules Setup ✅

- **Status**: Complete (100%)
- **Repository**: <https://github.com/igrechuhin/Synapse.git>
- **Location**: `.cortex/rules/shared/`
- **Impact**: Centralized rule management enabled

### Phase 9.3: Performance Optimization

- **Status**: Phase 9.3.3 Complete (100%)
- **Performance Score**: 9.0/10
- **Next**: Phase 9.3.4 - Medium-Severity Optimizations

## Completed Milestones

### 2026-01-11: Dynamic Synapse Prompts Registration ✅

- Added dynamic Synapse prompts registration module (`synapse_prompts.py`)
- Automatically loads and registers prompts from `.cortex/synapse/prompts/` directory
- Prompts are registered as MCP prompts at import time
- Updated Synapse submodule with prompts and rules directories
- Enables automatic prompt registration without manual code changes

### 2026-01-11: Synapse Integration and Refactoring ✅

- Refactored shared rules to use Synapse manager architecture
- Added SynapseManager, SynapseRepository, and PromptsLoader modules
- Added Synapse tools for MCP operations (sync, update rules/prompts)
- Removed old shared rules implementation (~3000 lines)
- Integrated Synapse into manager system with lazy loading
- All tests passing (2177 passed, 3 skipped)
- Improved architecture with proper separation of concerns

### 2026-01-11: Synapse Path Refactoring ✅

- Renamed `.cortex/rules/shared/` to `.cortex/synapse/` for better naming
- Updated all code references, configuration, and documentation
- Updated symlinks: `.cursor/synapse` → `../.cortex/synapse`
- More accurate name reflects that Synapse contains rules, prompts, and config
- All tests passing, code quality maintained

### 2026-01-11: Shared Rules Repository Migration ✅

- Migrated all local rules to shared repository structure
- Rules organized by category (general/, markdown/, python/)
- Removed duplicate local rule files
- Centralized rule management via Git submodule enabled
- All tests passing, code quality maintained

### 2026-01-10: MCP Prompts and Token Counter Improvements ✅

- Added 7 MCP prompt templates for setup and migration operations
- Improved token counter with timeout handling for tiktoken loading
- Updated README with comprehensive prompts documentation

### Phase 9.3.3: Final High-Severity Optimizations ✅

- Optimized file_system.py lock acquisition
- Optimized token_counter.py markdown parsing
- Optimized duplication_detector.py pairwise comparisons
- Performance Score: 8.9 → 9.0/10

## Upcoming Milestones

### Phase 10.4: Test Coverage Improvement

- **Status**: Planning
- **Current Coverage**: 88.52%
- **Target Coverage**: 90.00%+
- **Priority**: High (CI failing due to coverage threshold)
- **Plan**: `.cursor/plans/phase-10.4-test-coverage-improvement.md`
- **Focus**: Add tests for zero/low-coverage modules
  - Tier 1: `resources.py` (0%), `manager_groups.py` (0%)
  - Tier 2: `prompts_loader.py` (13%), `container_factory.py` (44%), `rules_manager.py` (50%)
  - Tier 3: `synapse_tools.py` (70%), `symlinks.py` (72%), `synapse_repository.py` (77%), `synapse_manager.py` (76%)

### Phase 9.3.4: Medium-Severity Optimizations

- Address remaining medium-severity performance issues
- Target performance score: 9.5/10+

### Phase 9.4+: Future Enhancements

- Documentation improvements
- Additional test coverage for edge cases
- Performance profiling with real-world workloads

## Project Structure Migration

### Current Migration Status

- Memory bank files migrated to `.cortex/memory-bank/`
- Plan files migrated from `.plan/` to `.cortex/plans/`
- Rules files migrated to `.cortex/rules/shared/` (shared repository structure)

## Notes

- All 2210 tests passing (3 skipped)
- **Current Coverage**: 88.52% (below 90% threshold - CI failing)
- **Target**: 90.00%+ coverage (Phase 10.4 in progress)
- Zero type errors
- Zero linting errors
