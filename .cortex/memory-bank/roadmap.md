- Automatically loads and registers prompts from `.cortex/synapse/prompts/` directory
- Prompts are registered as MCP prompts at import time
- Updated Synapse submodule with prompts and rules directories
- Enables automatic prompt registration without manual code changes

### 2026-01-11: Synapse Integration and Refactoring ✅

- Refactored shared rules to use Synapse manager architecture

- Added Synapse tools for MCP operations (sync, update rules/prompts)
- Removed old shared rules implementation (~3000 lines)
- Integrated Synapse into manager system with lazy loading
- All tests passing (2177 passed, 3 skipped)
- Improved architecture with proper separation of concerns

### 2026-01-11: Synapse Path Refactoring ✅

- Renamed `.cortex/rules/shared/` to `.cortex/synapse/` for better naming
- Updated all code references, configuration, and documentation
- Updated symlinks: `.cursor/synapse` → `../.cortex/synapse`
- More accurate name reflects that Synapse contains rules, prompts, and config
- All tests passing, code quality maintained

### 2026-01-11: Shared Rules Repository Migration ✅

- Migrated all local rules to shared repository structure
- Rules organized by category (general/, markdown/, python/)
- Removed duplicate local rule files
- Centralized rule management via Git submodule enabled

## Upcoming Milestones

### Phase 11.1: Fix Rules Tool AttributeError ✅ COMPLETE

- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETE (2026-01-12)
- **Goal**: Fix critical bug in `rules` tool preventing Phase 11 verification completion
- **Priority**: **CRITICAL** - Blocks Phase 11 tool verification
- **Plan**: `.cortex/plans/phase-11.1-fix-rules-tool-error.md`
- **Issue**: `AttributeError: 'LazyManager' object has no attribute 'is_rules_enabled'`
- **Root Cause**: Using `cast()` instead of `get_manager()` to unwrap LazyManager
- **Fix**: Replaced `cast()` with `await get_manager()` following established pattern
- **Impact**: Tool now functional, Phase 4 verification can proceed to 100%
- **Result**: All 34 tests passing, fix verified in code
- **Next**: Continue Phase 11 verification (restart MCP server to test tool)

### Phase 3 Extension: Infrastructure Validation (PROPOSED)

- **Status**: 📋 PROPOSED
- **Priority**: High (Prevents CI failures from infrastructure drift)
- **Plan**: `.cortex/plans/phase-3-infrastructure-validation.md`
- **Problem**: Phase 3 validation tools only check Memory Bank content, not project infrastructure consistency
- **Impact**: Issues like commit prompt missing CI checks are only caught by CI failures
- **Solution**: Extend `validate` tool with `check_type="infrastructure"` to validate:
  - Commit prompt vs CI workflow alignment
  - Code quality standards consistency
  - Documentation consistency
  - Configuration consistency
- **Estimated Effort**: 3-4 hours

### Phase 9.4+: Future Enhancements

- Documentation improvements
- Additional test coverage for edge cases
- Performance profiling with real-world workloads
