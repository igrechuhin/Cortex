## Completed Work (2026-03-24)

- **Lazy Synapse prompt registration and roots-safe project root** - Added `lazy_prompt_registration` so the first `list_prompts` resolves the workspace via `resolve_project_root_async` (MCP `roots/list` when the client advertises roots; skip when unsupported to avoid bridge crashes), then runs `register_synapse_prompts`, `sync_cursor_agents`, and conditional setup prompts; emits `notifications/prompts/list_changed` and short-circuits when startup registration already loaded Synapse prompts. Extended `project_root_resolver` with per-process root caching to avoid concurrent `list_roots` on stdio. Wired `server`/`main`, refactored Synapse `prompts_*` modules and `config/status`; tests in `test_lazy_prompt_registration`, `test_project_root_resolver`, `test_cursor_agent_sync`, `test_synapse_prompts`, `test_prompts_agents`.

## Current Focus

No queued pending plans under `.cortex/plans` in [roadmap.md](roadmap.md); next slice is chosen from Future Enhancements or the implement command.

## Recent Changes

Submodule hygiene for commits (2026-03-20): `pre_commit_submodule_guard` blocks Phase A when a submodule worktree is dirty or the gitlink is out of sync; covered by `test_pre_commit_submodule_guard.py` and pre-commit tool fixture patches.

Blocker (2026-02-09): create-plan and memory-bank-updater now mandate register_plan_in_roadmap for new plan entry to prevent roadmap corruption. Commit (2026-02-09): rules manager initialize mock, manage_file metadata test with usage-context patches; 3702 tests, 90.36% coverage.
