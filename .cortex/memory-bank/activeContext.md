## Current Focus

Next implementation slice: **[QG-S1] Add EXTENSION_SCRIPT_MAP** per [roadmap.md](roadmap.md) Blockers and `.cortex/plans/swift-qg-s1-add-extension-script-map.plan.md`.

## Recent Changes

Memory-bank guardrail (2026-04-01): when `roadmap_progress_consistency` fails, never create synthetic reconciliation/verification backlog entries. Only keep concrete, implementation-ready roadmap items tied to real deliverables.

Synapse sync timing (2026-03-28): submodule update runs when lazy prompts first register, after `resolve_project_root_async`, aligning sync with MCP roots (not only process CWD).

MCP startup Synapse sync (2026-03-29): dirty submodule worktrees are stashed around `git pull --ff-only origin main` inside `.cortex/synapse` (replacing superproject `git submodule update --init --recursive`); structured outcomes cover stash/push/pop edge cases; see AGENTS.md and `docs/guides/troubleshooting.md` MCP preflight.

Submodule hygiene for commits (2026-03-20): `pre_commit_submodule_guard` blocks Phase A when a submodule worktree is dirty or the gitlink is out of sync; covered by `test_pre_commit_submodule_guard.py` and pre-commit tool fixture patches.

Blocker (2026-02-09): Plan prompt and memory-bank-updater now mandate register_plan_in_roadmap for new plan entry to prevent roadmap corruption. Commit (2026-02-09): rules manager initialize mock, manage_file metadata test with usage-context patches; 3702 tests, 90.36% coverage.
