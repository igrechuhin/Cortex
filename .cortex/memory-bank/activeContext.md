## Completed Work (2026-03-25)

- **Detached fix worker pipeline + docs-path compliance hardening** - COMPLETE. Added `pre_commit_fix_worker.py` integration path coverage with `test_fix_quality_detached.py`, exposed `parse_fix_envelope` public wrapper to avoid private-symbol test imports, and updated `debug-external-integration.md` wording to remove stale legacy cursor path references that violate docs path guard tests.

- **Lazy setup prompt imports, session rollup, Synapse analytics** - COMPLETE. Pyright suppression comments aligned on private prompt imports in lazy_prompt_registration.py; context-usage-statistics and memory-bank index/history refreshed; Synapse usage event cache updated for 2026-03-24 and 2026-03-25.

- ✅ **Startup repair lifecycle recovery** - COMPLETE (2026-03-25) - Added `repair_project_setup` (idempotent) to validate/repair `.cortex/` structure, Cursor symlinks, and append Cortex transient markers to `.gitignore` for git repos; included unit tests.

## Current Focus

No queued pending plans under `.cortex/plans` in [roadmap.md](roadmap.md); next slice is chosen from Future Enhancements or the implement command.

## Recent Changes

Submodule hygiene for commits (2026-03-20): `pre_commit_submodule_guard` blocks Phase A when a submodule worktree is dirty or the gitlink is out of sync; covered by `test_pre_commit_submodule_guard.py` and pre-commit tool fixture patches.

Blocker (2026-02-09): create-plan and memory-bank-updater now mandate register_plan_in_roadmap for new plan entry to prevent roadmap corruption. Commit (2026-02-09): rules manager initialize mock, manage_file metadata test with usage-context patches; 3702 tests, 90.36% coverage.
