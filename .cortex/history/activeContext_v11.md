## Completed Work (2026-04-12)

- ✅ **Wiki ingest routing (PARTIAL)** - COMPLETE (2026-04-12) - When `.cortex/wiki/` exists, MCP `ingest` stores raw markdown under `wiki/sources/`, emits a frontmatter summary page (category from tags), appends `wiki/index.md`, and cortex://context recent-ingest prefers wiki `sources/` over memory-bank.

- ✅ **Project Wiki for Attached Projects (PARTIAL)** - COMPLETE (2026-04-12) - Registered `/cortex/query` Synapse workflow: `query.md`, manifest, `query` prompt icon, `TestQuerySynapsePrompt`. Plan Step 5 done; Steps 6–8 remain.

- ✅ **Wiki staged ingest helper (PARTIAL)** - COMPLETE (2026-04-12) - Added `cortex.tools.wiki` with `wiki_ingest_staged_docs` for commit-pipeline wiki updates; patterns configurable via schema frontmatter; `ingest_source_at_project_root` exposes sync ingest for tooling.

- ✅ **Project Wiki (PARTIAL): commit wiki ingest bridge** - COMPLETE (2026-04-12) - Synapse commit.md documents Phase A→B call to wiki_ingest_staged_docs and staging wiki outputs before Phase B docs gate.

- ✅ **Project Wiki (PARTIAL): idempotent staged wiki ingest** - COMPLETE (2026-04-12) - Commit-time `wiki_ingest_staged_docs` now keys on `stable_ingest_rel` (repo path slug): identical content returns skipped/unchanged; updates archive prior raw under `sources/{slug}-v{n}.md` and refreshes the deterministic wiki summary with a cumulative `## Revision` section.

- ✅ **Project Wiki (PARTIAL): init_wiki lazy registration** - COMPLETE (2026-04-12) - `init_wiki` MCP prompt is no longer always registered from the Synapse manifest; it appears only when `.cortex/wiki/schema.md` exists and no summary pages exist under concepts/entities/decisions/workflows/analyses (sources-only does not suppress). Registration runs on first `list_prompts` after startup repair, independent of `should_mount_setup`.

- ✅ **Project Wiki for Attached Projects (.cortex/wiki/)** - COMPLETE (2026-04-12) - Shipped .cortex/wiki layout, session wiki_status, conditional init-wiki registration, wiki-aware ingest and index updates, ask prompt, file_artifact mirror to wiki/analyses, wiki lint checks including index staleness, idempotent wiki_ingest_staged_docs for commits, self-hosted wiki seed; Synapse analyze/review prompts now record memory-bank and wiki mirror paths for filed analyses.

## Current Focus

Next implementation slice: **[QG-S1] Add EXTENSION_SCRIPT_MAP** per [roadmap.md](roadmap.md) Blockers and `.cortex/plans/swift-qg-s1-add-extension-script-map.plan.md`.

## Recent Changes

Memory-bank guardrail (2026-04-01): when `roadmap_progress_consistency` fails, never create synthetic reconciliation/verification backlog entries. Only keep concrete, implementation-ready roadmap items tied to real deliverables.

Synapse sync timing (2026-03-28): submodule update runs when lazy prompts first register, after `resolve_project_root_async`, aligning sync with MCP roots (not only process CWD).

MCP startup Synapse sync (2026-03-29): dirty submodule worktrees are stashed around `git pull --ff-only origin main` inside `.cortex/synapse` (replacing superproject `git submodule update --init --recursive`); structured outcomes cover stash/push/pop edge cases; see AGENTS.md and `docs/guides/troubleshooting.md` MCP preflight.

Submodule hygiene for commits (2026-03-20): `pre_commit_submodule_guard` blocks Phase A when a submodule worktree is dirty or the gitlink is out of sync; covered by `test_pre_commit_submodule_guard.py` and pre-commit tool fixture patches.

Blocker (2026-02-09): Plan prompt and memory-bank-updater now mandate register_plan_in_roadmap for new plan entry to prevent roadmap corruption. Commit (2026-02-09): rules manager initialize mock, manage_file metadata test with usage-context patches; 3702 tests, 90.36% coverage.
