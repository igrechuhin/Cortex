## Key Principles

### 1. Human Readability First

- All files remain markdown format
- Metadata stored separately (.memory-bank-index)
- No special syntax required (until Phase 2)

### 2. Git Compatibility

- Files work with standard Git workflow
- Metadata not committed to Git
- Enhanced conflict detection and resolution

### 3. Data Safety

- Always create backups before changes
- Automatic rollback on errors
- Version history for all modifications

### 4. Minimal Friction

- Auto-detect migration needs
- Auto-migrate with one command
- Auto-update metadata on changes

### 5. Progressive Enhancement

- Each phase builds on previous
- Backward compatible
- Optional features don't break core functionality

### Phase 11: Project Rebrand - "Cortex" ⏳ PLANNED

**Status:** 0% - Planning Complete, Ready for Execution
**Priority:** HIGH
**Goal:** Rename project from "Cortex" to "Cortex"
**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 days

**Rationale:**

- "Cortex" reflects the brain's memory and learning center
- Professional, memorable, reflects AI memory capabilities
- Short, brandable name suitable for production release

---

#### Phase 11.1: Package Structure Rename ⏳

**Status:** Planned | **Priority:** CRITICAL (Do First) | **Estimated:** 2-4 hours

**Directory Renames Required:**

```text
src/cortex/           →  src/cortex/
├── analysis/                  →  ├── analysis/
├── benchmarks/                →  ├── benchmarks/
├── core/                      →  ├── core/
│   └── protocols/             →  │   └── protocols/
├── guides/                    →  ├── guides/
├── linking/                   →  ├── linking/
├── managers/                  →  ├── managers/
├── optimization/              →  ├── optimization/
├── refactoring/               →  ├── refactoring/
│   └── reorganization/        →  │   └── reorganization/
├── rules/                     →  ├── rules/
├── structure/                 →  ├── structure/
│   └── lifecycle/             →  │   └── lifecycle/
├── templates/                 →  ├── templates/
├── tools/                     →  ├── tools/
└── validation/                →  └── validation/
```

**Steps:**

1. ⏳ Create backup branch: `git checkout -b backup/pre-rename`
2. ⏳ Rename main package directory: `mv src/cortex src/cortex`
3. ⏳ Verify directory structure intact
4. ⏳ Commit: "Phase 11.1: Rename package directory to cortex"

**Risk Mitigation:**

- Create backup branch before starting
- Complete Phases 11.1-11.4 in single session (imports will be broken until complete)
- Run verification (Phase 11.8) before updating documentation
- Keep git commits atomic and revertible
